# LandingPage
This is my first landing page inspired by Karasuno school's volleyball team from the anime "Haikyuu".
It was created using HTML and CSS using meta tags. Unfortunately, I couldn't run the codes in a responsive way, which ended up causing bugs when resizing the page using zoom in and zoom out, which makes it look "right", only at 1360x768, which is the resolution of my monitor. Suggestions?
